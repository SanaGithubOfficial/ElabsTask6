# Password Strength Evaluation 

## Objective

The goal of this evaluation was to understand how password complexity influences security, test different types of passwords using online password strength checkers, and summarize best practices and known attack methods.


## Password Evaluations
### Some other examples for practices:
#### 1. password123
This password includes only lowercase letters and digits. It's 11 characters long and is very common. It was flagged as weak by both Kaspersky and NordPass. It's easily guessable and would be cracked instantly using a dictionary or brute-force attack.


#### 2. Pass@word
This uses uppercase, lowercase, a digit, and a symbol. While better than the previous one, it follows a widely known pattern and was still marked as moderate by most checkers. This password is vulnerable to hybrid attacks.


#### 3. !X7m$w2#Qr
A strong, 10-character password with a mix of all character types. The structure is non-obvious, making it harder to guess. It received a strong rating due to its randomness and entropy.


#### 4. RainCloud$42*Secure
A 19-character phrase that includes symbols and digits. This was rated as very strong, primarily because of its length and unpredictability. Long passphrases with complexity are significantly more secure.


#### 5. 123456
Purely numeric and only six characters long. This was rated very weak and is among the most commonly used passwords in real-world breaches.


#### 6. G!t-9kPz#@vW_3
A highly complex password with uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, and no obvious pattern. It received a very strong score, emphasizing that true randomness makes a password very hard to crack.


## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

Always use at least 12 to 16 characters.

Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

Avoid any dictionary words, personal names, or known substitutions like @ for a.

Prefer randomly generated passwords from a password manager.

Never reuse passwords across websites or services.

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an additional layer of protection.



## Common Password Attack Methods

Brute-force attacks attempt every possible combination. These become unfeasible with long and complex passwords.

Dictionary attacks use precompiled lists of common words and known passwords, making simple or reused passwords vulnerable.

Credential stuffing involves using stolen username-password combinations on multiple sites. This is why password reuse is dangerous.

Hybrid attacks combine dictionary words with common variations or numbers, targeting weak “clever” passwords like Winter2023!.



## How Password Complexity Affects Security

The complexity of a password directly increases its entropy, which is the number of possible combinations an attacker must try to guess it. As a result:

Short, simple passwords are easy to crack in seconds.

Longer, more complex passwords significantly increase the time and computing power required.

Adding symbols and case variation reduces predictability, even for dictionary-based guessing.


In essence, every extra character and layer of complexity adds exponential difficulty for attackers.


## Summary of Lessons Learned

Common passwords are instant vulnerabilities.

Length is more important than complexity alone.

Truly strong passwords are either long passphrases or randomly generated.

Tools like password managers help you generate and manage these securely.

Brute-force and dictionary attacks can be countered simply by using strong, unique passwords.
